![advent-of-code-2023](https://github.com/DJE98/advent-of-code-2023/assets/73851419/4389ab00-0374-4785-ae98-b340b4d12958)

## Overview
This repository contains my personal solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Each solution is written in Python and is accompanied by comprehensive unit tests to ensure correctness and robustness.

## Structure
- **Solutions**: Each day's challenge has its own directory, named `dayX`, where `X` is the day number. Inside each directory, you will find the Python script containing the solution.
- **Unit Tests**: Accompanying each solution is a set of unit tests, written using Python's `unittest` framework. These tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to validate the functionality of the solutions.

## Running the Solutions
To run any solution, navigate to the respective day's directory and execute the Python script. For example:
```bash
cd day1
python main.py
```
